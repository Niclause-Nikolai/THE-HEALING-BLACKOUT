This is not only a symbolic gesture but rather calls one to real action with environmental issues we experience in current times, including pollution and wasteful consumption of energy and usage of natural resources to mention but a few. Further encouraged through this campaign are discussions surrounding sustainable practices and solutions to the climate to inspire long-term change in habits and policies toward it.<br><br>

                        The act of turning off lights during Earth Hour has reduced energy consumption, decreased carbon emissions, improved air quality, and helped protect natural resources, such as water and fossil fuels. Moreover, through this global movement, millions of people from different cultures and backgrounds with a sense of responsibility and a hope for a better future are united.

                        1. Limit Pollution
By saving energy we thus reduce harmful emissions from fossil fuel-powered electrical plants, thus providing more transparent air and a cleaner surrounding<br><br>

2. Heal the Ozone Layer
Every little move makes a difference in reducing depletion caused to the ozone layer-which shields us against negative ultraviolet rays<br><br>

3. Sustainable Lighting
During the Earth Hour, LED Lights are a perfect replacement where energy consumption is minimal; while it lasts longer than bulbs or incandescent lights.<br><br>

4. Conserve Energy
Switch off unnecessary lights to lower the electricity bill and save limited resources, which will leave an impact on the planet as well as your pocket for good.<br>

                        1. Switch off unnecessary lights
The very basic activity for Earth Hour is to switch off all unnecessary lights, appliances, and electronic equipment for one hour.<br><br>

2. Spread the word
Urge friends, family, and colleagues to participate and increase awareness about the importance of sustainability.<br><br>

3. Use the hour to get involved in pro-environment activities
These may include meaningful discussions on climate, community clean up, or individual commitments to reduce consumption of energy.<br><br>

4. Attend or organize local actions
There is an increasing behavior nowadays in terms of doing local events that push the campaign forward like holding outdoors, candlelight vigils, and so many more that can help encourage the move.<br><br>
